  exceeded our limit for reading (%d)` message

### Deprecated

## 5.1.0 - 2020-11-02

### Added

- [#190](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout-apm-php/pull/190) Added check to ensure response length is not larger than a
  reasonable limit (10mb currently) to avoid allocating too much memory on reading responses.
- [#195](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout-apm-php/pull/195) Added a TTL to metadata cache status of 10 minutes. This

### Added

- [#185](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout-apm-php/pull/185) Added support for TCP communication to core-agent via a
  `tcp://` formatted URI and set as default strategy.

### Changed

- [#187](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout-apm-php/pull/187) **[BC]** Limit number of spans to 1,500
  - Span information collected is hard-limited to 1,500 spans to avoid collecting too much data. A new `notice` will be
    emitted into the logger if this happens, and a `TagRequest` applied.
  - `\Scoutapm\ScoutApmAgent::startSpan` may now return `null`. A not-`null`-check should be performed on the result,
    for example `if ($span !== null) { ... }`.
  - `\Scoutapm\ScoutApmAgent::startSpan` now returns a `\Scoutapm\Events\Span\SpanReference` which is a new public API
    for accessing a `Span` (which is marked `@internal`).
  - `\Scoutapm\ScoutApmAgent::instrument`, `::webTransaction`, `::backgroundTransaction` all now accept `callable` for
    their respective `$block` parameters instead of `\Closure`. Additionally, if a parameter type declaration has been
    applied on the given `callable`, they must be updated to accept a `null`able `?SpanReference` instead of a `Span`.
    For example change `static function (Span $span) { ... }` to `static function (?SpanReference $span) { ... }`.
- [#183](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout-apm-php/pull/183) Try to filter out all `vendor/` files from backtraces
